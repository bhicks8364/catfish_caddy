# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Color.create([{ name: 'Red' }, { name: 'Orange' }, { name: 'Green' }, { name: 'Blue' }, { name: 'White' }, { name: 'Yellow' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
